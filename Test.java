/**
 * Q2 why u want to work as front end / android engieer
 * 
 * It is an exciting career because it’s always evolving 
 * and constantly changing. This means I’ll always have the opportunity to interact with new tools and 
 * learn new skills. It’s a field that provides many opportunities for 
 * hands-on learning. It could be an opportunity to experience a whole new world that allows me to 
 * create and develop valuable products for people.
 * 
 * 
 * Q4 What are you most passionate about in life? Why? *
 * 
 * “One area that I’m passionate about is self-development and self-improvement in my personal life. 
 * I’m always looking to challenge myself and learn new things. That’s one reason I enjoy participating in various coding contests,
 * learning new technologies like android and web development. I’ve learned great communication skills, listening skills, and problem-solving 
 * skills that help me in my day-to-day work but also in my personal life in terms of confidence, communication, etc.”
 * 
 * Q5  Do you usually strive for speed or perfection? Why? *
 * 
 * I personally feel that speed is more important than perfection, because in real life scenarios most of the time
 * it is very hard to get the things perfectly done. So according to me we should focus on speed and
 * completing the task as soon as possible and then start looking for what we can improve. I believe 'Perfection' is just 
 * result of many small improvements we do and these small improvements can only happen when we get feedback of what we have
 * done already"
 * 
 * Q6
 * Talk about the biggest engineering problem that you solved in your past experiences
 * 
 *I take every new task or responsibility of my work as a challenge and then try to give my best to come up with the 
 most-right solution to each situation. During one of our project works, one of the 3 members of our team was slacking off 
 and not doing their share of the work. Our professor delegated the tasks to each of us and we diligently worked on them, 
 making periodical progress reports. However, one of the members was not. I talked to him about the issue and got to 
 the crux of the problem. I motivated him to work on the task and helped him accomplish the goal, 
 because we were a team and we shared the load whenever we could. At the end of it all, our project was a success.
