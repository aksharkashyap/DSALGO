tree edge: If v was discovered for the first time when we traversed (u,v)
back edge: If v was already on the stack when we tried to traverse (u,v)
forward edge: If v was already discovered while u was on the stack.(u,v)
cross edge: Any edge that is not a tree, back, or forward edge.

To better understand this, consider the following C++ pseudocode:

// initially false
bool discovered[n]; 

// initially false
bool finished[n];   

vector<int> g[n];

void dfs(int u) {
    // u is on the stack now
    discovered[u] = true;
    for (int v: g[u]) {
        if (finished[v]) {
            // forward edge if u was on the stack when v was discovered
            // cross edge otherwise
            continue;
        }
        if (discovered[v]) {
            // back edge
            continue;
        }
        // tree edge
        dfs(v);
    }
    finished[u] = true;
    // u is no longer on the stack
}
