/**
 * SCC algorithms can be used as a first step in many graph algorithms that work only on strongly 
 * connected graph.In social networks, a group of people are generally strongly connected (For example, 
 * students of a class or any other common place). Many people in these groups generally like some common 
 * pages or play common games. The SCC algorithms can be used to find such groups and suggest the commonly 
 * liked pages or games to the people in the group who have not yet liked commonly liked a page or played a 
 * game.
