1) eulerian paths and circuits
2) cycle detection in directed graph using bfs
3) cycle detection in undirected graph usin bfs
-------------------------------------------------------------
1) bfs without using queue
2) clone a graph
3) number of triangles in an undirected graph
4) kirchhoff's algo- for number of spanning tree of a graph
5) jhonson's algo for all pair shortest path -> v^2logv
6) dial's algo - optimized dijsktra for small range weights
7) shortest and longest path in a DAG
8) transitive closure of a graph
9) max-flow ford fulkerson  - network flow
10) impliment an algo for splitwise app
11) Fluery's algo for printing eulerian path
application of all graph, greedy algorithms practical
