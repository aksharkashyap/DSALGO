1) articulation points(cut vertices) in a graph
2) biconnected components
3) flood fill algorithm


-------------------------------------------------------------
1) bfs without using queue
2) clone a graph
3) number of triangles in an undirected graph
4) kirchhoff's algo- for number of spanning tree of a graph
5) jhonson's algo for all pair shortest path -> v^2logv
6) dial's algo - optimized dijsktra for small range weights
7) shortest and longest path in a DAG
8) existence of eulerian paths and circuits
9) eulerian path algo
10) transitive closure of a graph
11) max-flow ford fulkerson  - network flow
12) impliment an algo for splitwise app

application of all graph, greedy algorithms practical
