knapsack
subset sum
equal sum partition
count of subset sum with given sum(weight)
minimum subset sum difference - imp - do it (left)
count the number of subset with given difference // target sum ---- both are same

------------------
1)unbounded knapsack

2)rod cutting problem - same as unbounded knapsack - nothing has to be changed
  -> value - price
  -> weight - pieces
  -> W(capacity) - N(size of array) )(if not given fixed capacity)
  -> dp[size+1][length+1]

3)coin change problem - max num of ways, min num of coins
