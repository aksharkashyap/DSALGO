Q-> doubly linkedlist using single pointer

Q-> Difference between Comparator and Comparable. Given a user-defined class Employee and list of employees, 
sort the list according to the age of employees. What you will use to sort, comparator or comparable and Why? 
How will you decide when to use comparable and when to use comparator

Q-> Internal working of HashMap in java. When to override equals() and when to override hashCode() method
